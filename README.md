Problem Statement

You are a data analyst at a retail company. Your manager has asked you to
analyze the sales data for the past 12 months and visualize it to identify any
trends or patterns.
Create a time series plot using Python to display the sales data.
Generate the sales data within your code.
The x-axis should represent the months, and the y-axis should represent the
sales figures.
Ensure that the plot is clear and well-labeled.
